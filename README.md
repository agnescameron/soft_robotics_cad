## Soft Robotic Tentacles

Each of the files in this repository is designed for use with the Parametric CAD software OpenSCAD. It's free to download and use, follow the install instructions [here](https://openscad.org/downloads.html) to get it running on your machine.

To modify the files, change the values at the top -- it might take a bit of tinkering to get the results you want!

OpenSCAD exports to .STL, which can then be sliced and 3D printed to form the basis for soft robotic moulds. If you're wondering how these moulds work, have a go with one of the readymade ones in the CCI before printing a new one.

If you write your own file feel free to contribute to the repository -- if you're not sure how to open a pull request you can chat to Agnes or one of the other CCI Technicians.
